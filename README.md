# Project Purpose

This project was made for my good friend's business. The front end is React on top of Apollo for GraphQL, and the backend is Yoga on top of Prisma. Payment processor is done through the Stripe API. The basic layout comes from Wes Bos' Advanced React and GraphQL course, although obvious alterations and customizations were made, and I was not compensated for building this site.
